# in_situ_analysis
This repository contains code for quantifying cell populations and marker intensities from in situ hybridization experiments, using output files from QuPath. The analysis is available both as a Python script (`in_situ.py`) and as a Jupyter notebook (`in_situ.ipynb`). You can use either for batch processing and summary statistics.
